# Simple format

A modern, minimalist course format for Moodle 5.0+ that presents one unit at a time with smooth transitions and a distraction-free learning experience. Inspired by clean, content-first design principles, Simple format strips away visual clutter so students can focus on what matters.

## Features

### Content display
- **Single-section display** with smooth crossfade transitions between units — no page reloads
- **Three-zone layout** automatically categorises activities into Learning Content, Related Resources, and Related Activities
- **Inline content rendering** — the primary learning item in each section (Page, Book, H5P, SCORM, YouTube/Vimeo) is embedded directly on the course page with a fullscreen toggle
- **Learning outcomes** configurable per section, displayed in a collapsible popout panel

### Navigation
- **Custom navigation panel** with SVG-based completion progress indicators — checkmarks, progress rings, and padlock icons for restricted sections (replaces Moodle's built-in course index)
- **Cog navigation** — a compact tile-grid popover replacing the secondary navigation bar, providing quick access to Participants, Grades, Settings, and 40+ other course tools with Font Awesome icons
- **Persistent home button** for navigating back to the course from any activity page
- **Unread forum badge** — displays a count of unread forum posts on the section 0 navigation button

### Course info
- **Course banner** (optional) — hero image with course name on section 0
- **Course Info overlay** (optional) — displays section 0 content in a floating modal accessible from every page in the course, preserving interactive widget state

### Responsive design
- **Desktop**: side-by-side navigation and content layout
- **Tablet and mobile**: stacked layout with animated hamburger drawer navigation
- **Keyboard and screen reader accessible** — full ARIA support, keyboard navigation, and focus management throughout

## How it works

Activities are automatically sorted into zones based on their module type:

| Zone | Module types |
|------|-------------|
| **Learning Content** | Page, H5P, SCORM, LTI, Lesson, Label, video URLs, and any module providing inline content via `cm_info` |
| **Related Resources** | URL, File, Book, Folder — with mimetype icons for PDFs, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, images, video, audio, and archives |
| **Related Activities** | Assignment, Quiz, Forum, and all other activity types |

The first learning content item in each section is rendered inline (embedded) rather than as a link. Completion tracking badges appear on every activity card, supporting both automatic and manual completion.
